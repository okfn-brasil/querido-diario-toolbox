# Contributing
Querido Diário has a [Contribution Guide](https://docs.queridodiario.ok.org.br/en/latest/contributing/contribution-guide.html#contributing) that is relevant to all of its repositories. The guide provides general information about how to interact with the project, the code of conduct you adhere to when contributing, the list of ecosystem repositories and the first actions you can take. We recommend reading it before continuing.
